Uses Llama3.1 instead of Llama2 and supports chat with pdf

You can chat either normally with Llama3.1 or upload as many pdfs you want and ask questions regarding those pdfs

You must keep a text file named token_file containing your hugging face access token. I have uploaded an example of the token_file that I used.

I used Linear Regression and Logistic Regression pdfs which are from CMU to test the app
